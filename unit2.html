  <h1>By Design: Intention In Poetry</h1>
<p> <i>By Design</i> is a study in the workings of conscious intention as evidenced in such elements of poetic design and rhyme, choice of title, the revision process, and the reinterpretation of a key word, figure, or narrative situation from earlier poems. Through a series of intensely scrutinized examples drawn from the Renaissance through the 20th century, Anne Ferry celebrates the ever-changing vitality of the act of writing poems within the constraints, pressures, and urginigs of history. In every instance, something startingly and significantly new takes place because of the high degree of conscious awareness with which such poets as Sidney, Shakespeare, Herber Woodsworth, Stevens, Williams, Frost, Ashvery read one another--and in some cases, themselves-- exploring and reinterpreting one another's vocabularies and ways of working in order to carry out their designs.</p>
